Homework 2 in Advanced Python

Databases and Python

The code is locate in src.database.
    db = Db() - creates new instance of Db class and also sets the location for database DINER.db, which takes place in
                database directory


    - To create CANTEEN table, call method create_canteen_table() from instantiated Db class

    - To create PROVIDER table, call method create_provider_table() from instantiated Db class

    - To insert necessary information in CANTEEN and PROVIDER tables, call db.create_records()

    - To get canteens which are open 16.15-18.00, call db.get_canteens_open_between_four_fifteen_and_six()

    - To get canteens which are serviced by Rahva Toit, call db.get_canteens_serviced_by_rahva_toit()



SqlAlchemy
To open the connection with the database, use:

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///../database/DINERS2.db', echo=True)

    - To create tables CANTEEN and PROVIDER, call create_tables() method, which creates tables from base.

    - To insert Itcollege canteen information in db, call add_it_college()

    - To insert other canteens and providers, call add_other_providers_and_canteens()

    - To get canteens which are open 16.15-18.00, call get_canteens_open_between_four_fifteen_and_six()

    - To get canteens which are serviced by Rahva Toit, call get_canteens_serviced_by_rahva_toit()
